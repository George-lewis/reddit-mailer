# Building It

If you're on Windows execute the batch file, else `go build`!

# Using It

You'll need to supply an agent file for the program to work, the program expects this file to be called `agent.txt` and placed in the same folder as the executable. [This wiki page](https://turnage.gitbooks.io/graw/content/chapter1.html) explains how to create an agent file.

After that place the executable, icons, and your agent.txt all in the same place and run the program!
